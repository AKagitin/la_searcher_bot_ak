# Contribution to LA Searcher Bot 


As far as this repo was developed as a first pet-project, there are 
a lot of areas of improvement across the whole project.

Although author of the repo remains committed to maintain & develop 
LA Searcher Bot since 2021, efforts of one author are not enough. 

Support and contribution from the community would help to 
**save more lives** by speeding up lost-people searches by means of 
efficient communication with Searches.

The first two steps of contribution, that can help a lot, are:
* to optimize existing Python scripts to make it more reliable and quick
* to develop new features, which are still kept in backlog:
  * notifications of first-post updates
  * restriction of notifications: only about single search for some time
  * filter notifications based on radius from the Searches
  * etc.

The following contributions are also welcomed:
* Improved CI/CD, incl testing
* Improved PSQL usage
* Improved GCP costs
* Improved Monitoring
* Any ideas to make the Bot more productive

For contribution to the current repo please make pull request from your 
cloned repo. It will be reviewed within 5 business days.
